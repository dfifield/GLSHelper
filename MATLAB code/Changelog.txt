Version 1.0

10 Mar 2009
	- added feature to increase latitudinal search limits when both max index1 and max index2 are 0. Ie. no
	  matching temperatures. This helps to get it out of being stuck in a inappropriate local area.

26 Feb 2009
	- added outputing of temp sampling freq (if constant).

15 Feb 2009
	- added support for BAS loggers. Added support to compute indices differently since there is no secs_per_temp
	  and don't know proportion of day spent at given temp.

	- added ability to compute secs_per_temp automatically for geoltv2 loggers which have date info in temp
	  file.

9 Feb 2009
	- added msgbox to tell when sat image dates from filename and info header don't match
	- added Temperature File Type button group to select different format temp files (incomplete)

Jan 7, 2009
	- latitude was slowly creeping south one pixel at a time when there is a string of positions in a row 
	  with where the index3 scores are equal for all pixels (ie. 121 tied). Was due to neglecting to subtract
	  1 when calculating the index of the median pixel (start + offset -1) 


Jan 6, 2009
	- added a "lat" column to output, set to lat_sst by default. I'll fill in either lat_light or lat_sst by hand
	  after examining.

	- incorporated export_posn code directly into compute_SST_lat such that each position is output as it is
	  computed, negating the need to wait till all positions have been processed before any output is generated.
	  Especially usefull if it crashes part way through - at least you get what output you have so far.


Jan 5, 2009
	- added ability to deal with European floating point numbers in Geo_LT raw temp read. (ie. convert 21,275
	  to 21.275).

Version 0.99
Oct 7, 2008
	- added feature to extract on surface temperatures from logger temp data.

Oct 3, 2008
	- enabled feature to ignore pixels where cloud/land > 80%.

Sept 29, 2008
	- added ability to read temperature files that contain just a single temperature per line with no date/time
	  info. GUI now contains box for start date/time.

Sept 27, 2008
	- added ability to work with zipped (.bz2) SST satelite files without having to unzip them by hand. The code
	  copies and unzips each required file to a temporary location (.\tempsst) as necessary.

June 11, 2008
	- modified compute_SST_lat to only compute index2 and index3 for tied index1 and index2 pixels respecitively

June 5, 2008
	- figure out what to do about NaNs in index3 when comparing distributions. search areas with lots of NaNs
	  are being favoured since there are few actual SSTs drawn and thus few terms in the sum of squares
	  calcualtion, making the result small and thus selected for. Solution: compute sum of squares based only 
	  on list of SST measured by logger instead of all SSTs measure by logger AND satellite. This makes the
	  number of sum of square terms equal for all pixels. Still not sure what Teo intended.

May 2008
	- added index3

April 30, 2008
	- added daily latitudinal limit feature.

April 20, 2008
	- discovered search box width and height were reversed due to bug in get_bbox. Fixed.
	- tested effect of different size and shape search areas. Smaller gives tighter placement but is more 
	  likely to be unable to find a matching search box at all. Larger tends to give more dispersed positions
	  but fails to find SST based posn less often.

April 12, 2008
	- modified SST reading procedure: read all headers of HDF files at start and save. Use these to look for
	  SST datasets on the fly as needed.
	
	- installed bzip to handle bz2 files.
April 9, 2008
	- added fill_in_SST_temp which checks search area to see if SST temperatures have previously been computed 
	  for pixels of interest and only fills in those (from slope intercept form) that haven't previously been
	  done.

	- finished converting to reading in one SST dataset at a time.

April 8, 2008
	- added find_and_read_SST_file to load the correct SST dataset from satellite files on demand. Called from
	  compute_SST_lat each time the current SST data doesn't cover the current day being processed.


Dec 31, 2007
	- added fields to gui for search box size, delta temp, SST dir.

	- added progress messages to read_SST_data

	- changed default value for missing temperature to NaN from -100.0 - needs testing

	- added code to compute_SST_lat to look for SST data set for each day processed - partially tested
