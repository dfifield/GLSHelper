	- add option to collect status messages into a logfile.

15 Feb 2009
	- go through some days when index2 are all 0 and index3 all equal (but not zero??) and see why not. This
	  is the basis for widening the search range but not sure it's working right. Or is it only if a daily 
	  position doesn't exist. At any rate decide if this median position chosen should be accepted or 
	  declared unable to find (ie. set lat = 100).

28 Jan 2009
	- add option to only process certain date range of input file.


Jan 6, 2009
	- add code to import entire original multitrace output to avoid having to first import to access then 
	  export posns for SST corr.

	- daily lat limits are supposed to increase for each day that a position doesnt exist - ie if the 
	  tuna didn't surface. I don't think this is applicable here.
	  
	- add ability to get position data directly from Access dbase.

	- add ability to put SST position data directly back into Access dbase.

	- deal with positions that are more than 80 % cloud. See line 182 in compute_SST_lat

	- interposition latitude limit should not be in effect for first position (but it is). Need to fix.
	  Add an option to use the Start position as the first good lat?

	- compare doing 100 samples of size 50 in index_3 with doing a single sample of 5000

Oct 8, 2008
	- add a "header lines" option for position and temp file. # of lines to ignore at top of file.
Oct 3, 2008
	- need to think about what temperatures are being used from the logger for a given position. Should it be
	  only temperatures measured between sunrise and sunset (or vice versa), if known. Ie. that's the period
	  during which the light was measured to compute this point so those are the temperatures that should be used.
	  to do this you need to know the sunrise and set times used to compute the position. Teo couldn't have known
	  this for Lotek loggers. What did he do?


Sept 27, 2008
	- find better way to deal with storing options. Appdata


May 1, 2008
	- find a way to speed up reading in temperatures. See position reading code.

Dec 27, 2007

	- find out what size search box Scott used

	- find out what temperature data I sent Scott.  Did I filter out times when the bird was flying?
